        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
          I am Batuhan Sevin√ß, 24 years old and graduated from Civil
          Engineering. I am eager to learn new things, value ethical principles,
          and see myself as a confident, problem-solving and results-oriented
          team player. I strive to be one of the best professionals in my field
          by constantly improving myself. With my increasing interest in the
          software industry, I decided to advance my career in this field. I
          honed my skills by working on practical projects and constantly
          researching to expand my knowledge. I don't like to be stuck with
          limits, so I want to contribute to a company that will push the limits
          and always move forward.
